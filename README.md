# reflect5
BorlandC++, using C-version out of it.
This project got abandoned, as the Linux-only version of Reflect is now called **reflector**, and is most suited for ssh-based sessions:
- [here](https://github.com/serrasqueiro/reflect/tree/master/sockets/tcpori/reflect/src) - reflector.c at _github_

## Content
Reflect was originally based on Unix, only, and then I have tried to adapt it to Win32 version.
BorlandC++ was the elected tool at that time.

Here are the set of files, unversioned at that time, with dates, to make traceability better.
